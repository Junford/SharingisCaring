Array

1. Imagine you're building a basic to-do list application. 
You want to store tasks in an array. Users can add tasks to the list, mark tasks as done, 
and view their current tasks. 
How would you design the array and the corresponding functions to add tasks, mark tasks as done, and 
display the tasks using basic array manipulation in your chosen programming language?


2. You're developing a program to analyze student grades. 
You have an array that holds the scores of a student's quizzes (out of 10 points each). 
You need to calculate and display the average score. How would you iterate through the array and 
compute the average using a loop in your chosen programming language?
